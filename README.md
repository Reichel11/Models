# Configurations

1. What to do to create a new model?
  - training data (one array with the data itself and one array for the categories)
  - configure training data (fillvalue,...
  - set model configurations


# Model settings
1. What to change and what do they do?
 - Filter/Kernel size, activation function, Dense-layer, learning-rate, loss function,optimizer
# How to avoid Overfitting

1. What is overfitting?
2. What to use against overfitting?
  - Regularizations:Dropout, batchnorm, data augmentation, 

# Improvement Ideas

# Technical Requirements
Python (version 3.7) is required to use the models. Furthermore the installation of the following packages is necessary:
- Tensorflow – 2.7.0
- Keras – 2.6.0
- Pickleshare – 0.7.5
- Numpy – 1.19.5
- Matplotlib – 3.1.3
