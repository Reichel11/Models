# Prediction of MCC
Identification of open and closed mesoscale convective clouds (MCC) with two differently trained models (with automatic and manual data augmentation) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). For further details on the setup of the CNN see the description in the Master Thesis (*Master_Thesis.pdf*).

# Technical Requirements
Python (version 3.7) is required to use the models. Furthermore the installation of the following packages is necessary:
- Tensorflow – 2.7.0
- Keras – 2.6.0
- Pickleshare – 0.7.5
- Numpy – 1.19.5
- Matplotlib – 3.1.3
